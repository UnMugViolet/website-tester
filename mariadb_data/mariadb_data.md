## MariaDB Data Volume

In the Docker Compose file, the `mariadb_data` volume is mapped to `/var/lib/mysql` inside the MariaDB container. This volume serves a crucial role:

- **Database Files**: All the MariaDB database files are stored in this directory. This includes tables, indexes, and other database structures.

- **Persistence**: The `mariadb_data` volume is crucial for persisting data between MariaDB container restarts or updates. Without this persistence, all MariaDB data would be lost each time the MariaDB container is restarted or updated.

This mapping ensures that the data stored in the MariaDB database persists even if the container is stopped or removed. It's a common practice to use Docker volumes for database storage to ensure data isn't lost when updating or restarting containers.
