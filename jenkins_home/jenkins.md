## Jenkins Home Directory

The `jenkins_home` directory is a crucial component of a Jenkins setup. It serves several important functions:

- **Settings and Configurations**: All the settings and configurations for Jenkins are stored in this directory.

- **Build Artifacts**: The results of Jenkins builds, known as build artifacts, are stored here.

- **Persistence**: The `jenkins_home` directory is crucial for persisting data between Jenkins container restarts or updates. Without this persistence, all Jenkins configurations and build history would be lost each time the Jenkins container is restarted or updated.
